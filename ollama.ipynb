Cricket icon: Sachin had immense respect among players irrespective of their level (amateurs, domestic cricketers etc.), he was seen as an embodiment of the love for Indian Classical Cricket and a true sportsperson who played with his heart in every ball that came to bat. He is often credited with popularizing Indian cricket on global platforms including bringing corporates into it through sponsorship deals, leading Sachin's Army - an enthusisatsy of fans from all around the world and making Tendulkar a household name beyond his home country India.\n",

Philanthropist: Apart from being great on field performances, off-field too he has contributed immensely to society through Sachin’s Charity which works towards creating facilities for underprivileged children in Mumbai and all over the world. He also started a sports school named “The Tiger Club” where youngsters learn various aspects of cricket as well as life skills like respect, discipline etc., making him not just an exceptional player but a great role model too.\n"
