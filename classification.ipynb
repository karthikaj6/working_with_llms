      "  \n",
      "This doesn’t seem like an insider joke or a personal rant as it talks about general financial management advice, not specific to any individual's experience hence 'personal finance tip' is the most suitable category here over others such as #FinancialAdviceForYoungInvestors (which might be too narrow), PersonalStoriesFromMoneySavingExperiences() or NonProfitOrganizationGuidelines().\n",
      "\n",
      "The classification of tweets in terms like categories, tags etc. can help users to find content they are interested in and improve the discoverability for businesses who wish their posts/content be found by people with similar interests using AI techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) on text-based data inputs or social media APIs that provide accessibility to realtime tweet information.\n"
