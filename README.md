# RAG Example Project

This repository demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using **Ollama**, **LangChain**, **Chroma (Weaviate)**, and Python. 

---

## Features

- **Ollama**: Utilized for foundational large language models (LLMs).
- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM-powered applications, including RAG pipelines.
- **Chroma**: Vector database used for efficient document storage and similarity search.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval and generation to enhance the contextual relevance of responses.
